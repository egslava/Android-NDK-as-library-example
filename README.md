# Android-NDK-as-library-example
The easiest example of using Android NDK. Remember, you can't use debugger in native library project [cause of bug](http://egslava.ru/androidstudio-bug-report-cant-use-debugger-with-ndk-library/) (in Android Studio?).

So it would be much better if you keep your own native code in your main project.
